# sysbench-docker
This project consists of two branches.
Both branches contains an alpine 3.9.6 docker image and dockerfiles with sysbench benchmarks installed.
One with sysbench-1.0.17 (fixed) image and dockerfile and the other with rolling dockerfile and to date most recent sysbench-1.1.0 image.

Hope you'll find it usefull :)
