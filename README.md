This project consists of two branches.
Both branches contain an alpine 3.9.6 docker images with sysbench benchmarks installed and the dockerfile used to build the images as well.
One branch with sysbench-1.0.17 (fixed) image and dockerfile and the other with rolling dockerfile and to date most recent sysbench-1.1.0 image.

Hope you'll find it usefull :)
